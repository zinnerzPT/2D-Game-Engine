# 2D-Game-Engine

A simple 2D Game Engine written in C++ by two Games and Multimedia students.

Included is also a simple example 2D space shooter using the assets from the game [Xenon 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMWRH_69Xo4&ab_channel=IdealsoftBlog.it).

This engine and game were delivered as projects for two different classes: Advanced Game Programmign Topics and Computer Graphics.
We were graded 19.2 out of 20 and XX out of 20 for each class respectively.
